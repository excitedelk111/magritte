          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            This VR project was part of an Experimental Collaborative Scholarly
            Course at Brown called "Simulating Reality". The original idea was
            to just create a 3D rendition of Magritte’s Painting,
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-6327892"
            >
              La Vengeance</a
            >, in VR. There is nothing more challenging than recreating the
            works of Surrealist artists in 3D, especially the work of someone
            like Magritte, as surrealism is meant to depict illogical,
            unrealistic scenes and his work is some of the best, if not the
            best. After a bit of work on the project we decided to expand its
            scope to take full advantage of what VR offers. Magritte questions
            the status of representation in his paintings. We felt like the best
            way to translate that intention into the modern world would be to
            have a VR experience that allows users to experience both possible
            realities in this painting.

          <h3>The Experience</h3>
          <p>
            The viewer will be able to walk around the room and enter the
            painting within the painting, a second ‘reality’. The user is able
            to switch between a landscape painting and clouds painted onto the
            wall to a window with real mountains and real clouds.

          <h3>Texturing and Shading</h3>
          We created these paint textures in Photoshop and Blender to mimic the
          texture of the original painting. Some of the textures were done using
          Image Projection (such as the metal ball).
          <div class="image-wrapper" style="margin-top: 2%; margin-bottom: 3%">
            <img src="./images/textures.png" style="width: 70%" />
          </div>
          One of our biggest challenges was creating the shader for the 3D scene
          inside the painting, so that only the parts contained inside the
          painting would be seen, and the rest hidden.
          <div class="image-wrapper" style="margin-top: 2%; margin-bottom: 3%">
            <img src="./images/stencil-buffer.png" style="width: 50%" />
          </div>
          We found an existing resource online on something called a Stencil
          Buffer, adapted it by writing our own shaders that preserved the
          texture of the objects but also allowed them to “disappear” outside
          certain boundaries. We figured out variations of the script we found
          online for the easel, clouds, mountains, painting frame, which were
          all using slightly different combinations of code.

          <h3>Equipment</h3>
          <p>
            We initially only had access to an HTC Vive, but after setting up
            our project, we realised that there were many limitations. The roof
            in the model was low and so the painting appeared small and this was
            because the physical room is small and the HTC Vive's recognizable
            free space was bounded by the physical room in which it was set up.
            We were able to touch two physical walls but not the other two. We
            could have possibly set dressed the space so people could feel more
            with their hands while exploring the space - prop walls, easel and
            canvas? but does that take away or add something? We eventually got
            access to an Oculus Quest 2 and used it for our project which
            addressed all the limitations that were associated with the Vive.
            After setting it all up, we also realised that it was very difficult
            to get the users’ eye-line to line up with the exact point we would
            need them to be at for a seamless transition between the 3D clouds
            (real) and projected clouds (painting), so, ee decided to use a
            button that allows users to click to switch between the 2 forms.
            Alternatively, we could teleport people back to the exact point and
            remove the walking component, but we felt like what made this
            project more immersive was the ability to walk around the room.

          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p>
            Below are side-by-side comparison images of the projected 2D world
            (on the left) and the 3D world (on the right). The switch is
            triggered by pressing the buttons on the sides of both controllers
            to switch back and forth. The switch is also accompanied by ambient
            noise of a mountainous region that switches on and off.
